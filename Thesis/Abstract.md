#Abstract

This project aims to present the design and implementation of a game server management tool, leveraging containerisation technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes to streamline the deployment and management of multiplayer game servers. 

While primarily focused on game-specific workflows, the architecture will be designed to be modular and extensible, showcasing its potential application in general infrastructure automation. 

By integrating features such as autoamted resource provisioning, container orchestration, and web-based user management, the system should serve as both a practical tool for gamers, and a proof of concept for broader infrastucture use cases.
